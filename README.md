# Network-Interchangeable-Project-SwiftUI-MVVM
This is an app which has interchangeable web service feature. To be more precise, there are three files in Service folder. Networkservice is protocol file that can be used by Webservice and Localservice. We can change network between Webservice and Localservice thanks to Networkservice protocol. Moreover, I desing the app with MVVM design pattern. I created Model file with structs and these structs have Codable typealias whic is combination of codable and encodable protocols. As for View Model, I benefited from @Published typealias to make a connection between View Model and View. In addition to that, the class of View Model has inherited from ObservableObject protocol, again, to connect View Model and View files. Also, I dowloaded the data I'd like to show the users in this file. Besides, I selected the data I will demonstrate to users specifically, so I did not show all the data came from Json file. Furthermore, in Content View, I used @ObservedObbject as a  @frozen public struct to make a connection with View Model. In this file, specifically, I demosntrated the data to the users in the form of list. Finally, in Constants folder, I created struct with Swift Singleton and located the JSON link here.
